# Notes App
 
This is an application that allows users to take notes. It is a full stack application with client made in React and server made in Strapi. I made this app in order to learn to work with API in React and how to implement basic features that are common in every application, such as: Authentication, CRUD, filters, pagination etc...

## What have I learned?
- Fetching data using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview). I wish I used that library much ealier.
- JWT authentication.
- Making pagination using [react-paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate).
- Filtering fetched data.
- Implementing markdown editor in notes.
- Using headless CMS like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/).
- Handling request errors.
- Getting query params using [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string)
- Given the fact that this is my second project in typescript, the ability to use this language has improved.
- Implementing notifications by using [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify).
- Improving SEO by using [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet)

For such a small application I have learned a lot.
